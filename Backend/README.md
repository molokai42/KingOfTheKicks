# Documentation

- **Scalable server:** [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Static types:** TypeScript types for GraphQL queries & mutations are generated in a build step
- **Auth:** Signup/login workflows ready to use
- **Database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (MySQL)
- **Tooling:** Support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible:** Simple/Flexible [data-model](./database/datamodel.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup
- **Realtime updates:** GraphQL subscriptions (_coming soon_)

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Navigate to the new project
cd (this-app)

# 2. Install Dependencies for NPM
yarn 

#3 Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
 Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev

```

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
